
Currently, Duvet doesn't resolve requireRS modules with FileHandler. 
That's because requireJS uses relative moduleIDs as paths to find other modules.
When ColdFeet alters the URLs, then it'll be redirecting and 404'ing all over the place.

So what Duvet needs to do, is walk the module directory and add module paths for each script file it finds.
